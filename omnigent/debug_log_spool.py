"""Local spool for debug-log rows the sink could not deliver.

Rows land here when shutdown runs out of time to send them, and after a
definite delivery failure. A later process replays them in the background.
Delivery is at-most-once: one process per machine replays (an exclusive file
lock), and a file is renamed to ``*.sending`` only as its POST starts, so a file
left in that state by a dead uploader is dropped rather than sent again.

Each line is a self-contained JSON record (``{"v", "dest", "row"}``), so a torn
or corrupt line costs only that row, never the rest of its file.
